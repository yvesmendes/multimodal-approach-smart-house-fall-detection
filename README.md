# A Multimodal Approach in Smart House for Fall Detection

The population of older adults is increasing quickly in the entire world. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, every 11 seconds an older adult is treated in the emergency room for a fall, and every 19 minutes an older adult dies from a fall. So it is important to identify and classify a fall correctly. Although health professionals do the monitoring of this people, the cost of this monitoring is expensive. A possibility for these people is a smart noninvasive system that monitors a daily behavior and emits alerts in case of detecting an abnormal event. To detect falls, sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used for the acquisition of data and in conjunction with the acquired image from cameras allow the creation of a multimodal approach to fall detection. This short paper focus on detecting falls using different classifiers in three data sets. The experiments realized show that it is possible to identify a fall with an accuracy of 99,70% in most scenarios.
